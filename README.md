# twenty-one-card-trick

GUI implementation of the known Twenty-one card trick

The program will show you 3 columns of 7 playing cards. Think about any card number and select the column that your card is in. This repeats 3 times, asking each time for the column that your card appears in.

After the third time/step, the program will tell you the card that you were thinking of.
